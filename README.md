 Bank Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction

Overview

Attracting new customers may not be the most cost-effective strategy for mature businesses, and thus, customer churn management becomes crucial. This project combines churn prediction and customer segmentation using customer data from a bank. The goal is to create an integrated customer analytics framework for effective churn management.

Project Components

1. Data Pre-processing:
   - Clean and prepare the customer data for analysis.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and any data anomalies.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyze and visualize the customer data to gain insights.
   - Understand patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - Utilize K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
   - Optimize the segmentation using a Random Forest model focusing on the F1 score.

4. Customer Characteristics Analytics:
   - Analyze customer characteristics within each segment.
   - Use feature importance from the Random Forest model to understand key factors.

5. Churn Prediction:
   - Apply various machine learning models with a focus on precision.
   - Address class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).
   - Evaluate model accuracy and precision in predicting customer churn.
